summary of hospital course 1 copd dyspnea pneumonia the patient was initially placed on an aggressive steroid taper and admitted to the medical intensive care unit due to her difficulty with oxygenation despite cpap machine she was also given nebulizer treatments q 4h as well as chest pt the nebulizers were increased to q 1h due to the fact that she continued to have labored breathing due to persistent respiratory failure and labored breathing the patient was intubated on 2118 6 7 in order to improve oxygenation ventilation and ability to suction a bronchoscopy was performed on 2118 6 7 which demonstrated marked narrowing of the airways with expiration consistent with tracheomalacia on 2118 6 9 two silicone stents were placed one in the left main stem 12 x 25 and one in the trachea 16 x 40 by dr first name stitle name stitle under rigid bronchoscopy with general anesthesia on 2118 6 11 the patient was extubated to a cool mist shovel mask and her oxygen was titrated down to 2

room air on 2118 6 14 the patient was seen again by the interventional pulmonology service who agreed that she looked much improved and recommended that she go to pulmonary rehabilitation with followup within six weeks time status post placement of stents in respiratory failure 2 cardiovascular the patient was ruled out for a mi she did have another episode on the medical floor of chest pain which showed no evidence of ekg changes and negative troponin negative cks x3 she was continued on aspirin imdur and diltiazem for rate control per her outpatient regimen 3 hypertension she was maintained on diltiazem and hydrochlorothiazide with adequate blood pressure control and normalization of electrolytes 4 hematuria the patient had intermittent hematuria likely secondary to foley placement the foley catheter was discontinued on 2118 6 14 she had serial urinalyses which were all negative for signs of infection 5 hyperglycemia patient was placed on insulin sliding scale due to hyperglycemia which was steroid induced this worked quite well and her glucose came back to normal levels once the steroids were tapered to off 6 leukocytosis patient did have a profound leukocytosis of 20 to 22 during much of her hospital course as the steroids were tapered to off her white blood cell count on 2118 6 14 was 15 000 it was felt that the leukocytosis was secondary to both steroids as well as question of a left lower lobe pneumonia 7 for the left lower lobe pneumonia the patient had initially received a course of levofloxacin 500 p o q d from 2118 6 4 to 2118 6 10 this was restarted on 2118 6 12 for an additional seven day course given the fact that she still had the leukocytosis and still had marked rales at the left lower lobe 8 hypothyroidism the patient was continued on outpatient medical regimen 9 depression the patient was continued on lexapro per outpatient regimen it is recommended that she follow up with a therapist as an outpatient due to the fact that she did have a blunted affect throughout much of the hospital course and did appear clinically to be depressed 10 prophylaxis she was maintained on proton pump inhibitor with subq heparin 11 sore throat the patient did have a sore throat for much of the hospital course post extubation this was treated with cepacol lozenges as well as kbl liquid a solution containing kaopectate bismuth and lidocaine at bedtime 12 communication code status the patient was full code throughout her hospital course and communication was maintained with the patient and her husband 13 muscle weakness the

extremities were 4 8 at the knee 4 8 at the ankle 4 8 at the elbows and 4 8 hips it was felt that this weakness was most likely due to a combination of steroid myopathy as well as muscle atrophy secondary to deconditioning after a prolonged hospital course 14 speech swallow the patient had a speech and swallow evaluation showing no evidence of dysphagia no evidence of vocal cord damage status
